# Nemosa

Website design for a cabinetmaker. This is my final project for my Web Development ASC (Attestation of College Studies).

It's a showcase and transactional website. It features an online store. Payments are made via Stripe.

This the React client side of the website. The server side of the website is written in PHP and can be found in this repository : [@marielGtGg/nemosa-api](https://github.com/marielGtGg/nemosa-api). 

All products are managed on Stripe plateform. Products are retreived through Stripe API to be displayed in the store ("Boutique").

Last creations section's content ("Dernières réalisations") is feeded through Instagram Basic Display API. It shows the 10 last posts made by the cabinetmaker on Instagram.
